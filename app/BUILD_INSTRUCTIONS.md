# Quizifications - iOS App Store Build & Submit Instructions

## Prerequisites

1. **Apple Developer Account** ($99/year) - https://developer.apple.com
2. **Expo Account** (free) - https://expo.dev
3. **EAS CLI** installed globally

## Step 1: Install EAS CLI

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

## Step 2: Login to Expo

```bash
eas login
```

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Before building, you need to set up the following secrets in your Expo account:

1. Go to https://expo.dev → Your Project → Secrets
2. Add these secrets:
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anon key
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLAUDE_API_KEY` - Your Anthropic Claude API key

## Step 4: Set Up Apple Credentials

EAS Build will automatically manage your iOS certificates and provisioning profiles. When prompted:

1. Select "Let EAS handle it" for credentials
2. Log in with your Apple Developer account
3. EAS will create and manage certificates for you

## Step 5: Create Production Build

```bash
cd app
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

This will:
- Build your app in the cloud (no Mac required!)
- Generate an `.ipa` file ready for App Store
- Take approximately 15-30 minutes

## Step 6: Submit to App Store

### Option A: Automatic Submit via EAS

First, update `eas.json` with your Apple credentials:

```json
"submit": {
  "production": {
    "ios": {
      "appleId": "your-apple-id@email.com",
      "ascAppId": "YOUR_APP_STORE_CONNECT_APP_ID",
      "appleTeamId": "YOUR_APPLE_TEAM_ID"
    }
  }
}
```

To find these values:
- **appleId**: Your Apple Developer account email
- **ascAppId**: App Store Connect → Your App → App Information → Apple ID
- **appleTeamId**: Apple Developer → Membership → Team ID

Then submit:

```bash
eas submit --platform ios --latest
```

### Option B: Manual Submit via Transporter

1. Download the `.ipa` from your EAS build
2. Download [Transporter](https://apps.apple.com/app/transporter/id1450874784) from the Mac App Store (or use a Mac via virtual service)
3. Upload the `.ipa` via Transporter
4. Go to App Store Connect to configure your app listing

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check that all environment secrets are set in Expo dashboard
- Verify your Apple Developer account is active
- Run `eas build --platform ios --profile preview` first to test

### Submit Fails
- Ensure your App Store Connect app is created first
- Verify Apple credentials in `eas.json` are correct
- Check that provisioning profiles match

### App Rejected
Common reasons:
1. Missing privacy policy - ensure URL is accessible
2. Subscription issues - ensure pricing is clear
3. Missing demo account - provide test credentials
4. Crash on launch - test with TestFlight first

## Testing Before Submit

```bash
# Build for internal testing
eas build --platform ios --profile preview

# Install on your device via TestFlight
# Or use Expo Go for development testing:
cd app
npx expo start
```

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Check build status
eas build:list

# View credentials
eas credentials

# Update over-the-air (after initial release)
